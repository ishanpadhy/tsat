# TSAT - Time Series Analysis Toolkit

## Overview
TSAT is a simple toolkit for analyzing and visualizing time series data. It provides features like data smoothing, outlier detection, resampling, rolling statistics, and plotting.

## Features
- Smooth time series data by removing outliers.
- Detect outliers using the IQR method.
- Resample time series data with custom frequencies.
- Compute rolling statistics (mean, standard deviation, median).
- Visualize time series data.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+ 
- Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, numpy

## Note
The files need to be in the same directory for the project to be executed. Any example project the user wishes to work on, must include the tsat.py file in the same directory

## Files
- tsat.py: Main script with the TimeSeriesAnalyzer class.
- test_tsat.py: Test script for validating the methods in tsat.py.
- Example.py : contains a small example file of how the function can be used.
- README.md: Project documentation.
